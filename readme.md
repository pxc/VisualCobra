VisualCobra
===========

Introduction
------------

VisualCobra is a Visual Studio 2010 extension providing support for the
[Cobra programming language](http://cobra-language.com/).

At present it simply provides syntax colouring for editing your code in
Visual Studio. You must still compile your Cobra code manually from the
command line. More features are planned for future versions.

If you just want to install the entension, use the Extension Manager in
the Tools menu of Visual Studio 2010. This package is the source code,
which is useful if you are a developer wishing to enhance the extension.

This extension was created by Matthew Strawbridge. The latest version of
this source code is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/pxc/VisualCobra).
There are some videos relating to this project on [my blog](http://www.matthewstrawbridge.com).
